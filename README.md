SpellWell is a web app designed to help with spelling. Users can create custom tests or choose from an official, competitive word list. The test interface has keyboard shortcuts and automatic audio playing to allow efficient testing sessions. Word pronuncations and definitions come from [Merriam-Websters Collegiate Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-dictionary). If a word does not have a pronunciation, the web speech API will be used.

Built with Vite, React, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI
